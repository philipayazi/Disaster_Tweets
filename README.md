# Disaster_Tweets

Twitter has become an important communication channel in times of emergency. The ubiquitousness of smartphones enables people to announce an emergency they're observing in real-time. Because of this, more agencies are interested in programatically monitoring Twitter (i.e. disaster relief organizations and news agencies).

But, it's not always clear whether a person's words are actually announcing a disaster. For example, "On plus side LOOK AT THE SKY LAST NIGHT IT WAS ABLAZE"

The author explicity uses the word "ABLAZE" but means it metaphorically. This is clear to a human right waway, especially with visual aid. But it is less clear to a machine.

In this project, a machine learning model is developed to predict which Tweets are related to real disaters and which one's are not.
